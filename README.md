# simple_tproxy

This is a simple transparent HTTP proxy.

I started to develop it as a transparent proxy to analyze applications that communicate without going through explicit proxies, but now it can be used as an explicit proxy as well.

At this time, CONNECT method and HTTP/2 and later protocols are not supported.
